## marchat

Chat server demonstration for the March Denver Gopher's meetup (marchat == Mar CH at); the slides are [online](http://talks.golang.org/denver.gophers/March28.slide).

```
Usage:
        marchat [-k file] [-p port] [-u username]
        
        -k file         file containing the AES key for the conversation; if
                        no key file is provided, encryption is turned off.
        -p port         port for web interface, defaults to 4000.
        -u user         username to send messages as, defaults to "anonymous".
```

## Installing:

        go get github.com/gokyle/marchat


## Example Keys:

Two AES keys have already been generated for demonstration purposes. These
are found in the source directory as `demo.key` and `wrong.key`. For the
talk, I've baked the keys into the binary; they may be selected with

        -key <keyname>

`<keyname>` should be either `demo` or `wrong`.


## Demo scenario:

* 2 users using 'demo.key'. (`marchat -u my_name -k demo.key`)
* 1 user with 'wrong.key'. (`marchat -u my_name -k wrong.key`)
* 1 user with no encryption. (`marchat -u my_name`)


## Usage:

Open your web browser to http://localhost:port, where port is the port you
specified in the options (or 4000 if you didn't). For example,

          http://localhost:4000 -u Joe


## Notes:

marchat uses UDP multicast for chatting; messages may be lost on the wire.
